# CloudStudio on Windows 10 GPU VM with Skype, NDI Runtime and OBS-NDI installed

![Best Practice Check](https://azurequickstartsservice.blob.core.windows.net/badges/obs-studio-stream-vm-chocolatey/BestPracticeResult.svg)

Live streaming is a hardware-intensive endeavor. Instead of buying your own hardware, it's better to leverage Azure.

This repository provides...

* ...an ARM template to deploy a powerful Windows 10 GPU VM and the network infrastructure required to access it with Azure Bastion.
* ...a PowerShell script to install all software required for streaming.
* ...additional configuration for installed software.

We call this combination of streaming related software and Azure compute resources "CloudStudio".

To use CloudStudio, follow these instructions:

## Step 1/3: Deploy the VM

The repo contains a deployment file [azuredeploy.json](azuredeploy.json) to set up the VM. The easiest way to deploy the VM is by clicking the "Deploy to Azure" button (you can visualize what's being deployed by clicking the "Visualize" button):

### Important notes

The virtual machine and all resources will be **deployed into the same region as the resource group** specified. The selection of a different region has no effect on the deployment.

Make sure to deploy the resource group into a region supporting NV-Series VMs. You can find a [complete list here](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/?products=virtual-machines&regions=non-regional,us-east,us-east-2,us-central,us-north-central,us-south-central,us-west-central,us-west,us-west-2,canada-east,canada-central,europe-north,europe-west,australia-central,australia-central-2,australia-east,australia-southeast,brazil-south,china-non-regional,china-east,china-east-2,china-north,china-north-2,south-africa-north,south-africa-west). By the time of writing, this is the list of supported regions. The ones we actively tested are shown in **bold**:

* Australia East
* **West Europe**
* North Europe
* **East US**
* East US 2
* North Central US
* **South Central US**
* West US 2

### How to choose a VM size

We recommend using a `Standard_NV6` size VM. We found this powerful enough to handle the streaming infrastructure.
The ARM template allows you to select a different size, if needed.

### Access the VM through Azure portal

When deployment is done, access the VM using Bastion's RDP:

* In Azure portal, go to the overview page of the deployed VM
* Click "Connect" in the top menu bar and select "Bastion"
* Enter the username and password provided in the ARM template

## Step 2/3: Install software

First, you should check and apply Windows Updates in the VM.

Software installation is based on a [PowerShell script](CloudStudioInstallscript.ps1) using Chocolatey package manager and by running other installers silently.

* Login to the VM using an RDP session (Azure Bastion, see above)
* Press "WINDOWS+R" to execute a command

Paste the following command to download the installation script to the VM:

```
powershell -command "Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kphillpotts/CloudStudio/master/CloudStudioInstallScript.ps1 -OutFile ~/Desktop/CloudStudioInstallScript.ps1 -UseBasicParsing"
```

* Check your Desktop and you should see a file called "CloudStudioInstallScript.ps".
* Press "WINDOWS+R" to execute another command

Paste the following command start the installation process:

```
powershell -ExecutionPolicy bypass -file %USERPROFILE%/Desktop/CloudStudioInstallScript.ps1
```
The installation can take up to 20 minutes.

When done, reboot the VM.

## Step 3/3: Additional configuration

There are some important configuration settings you will want to make once the software is installed:

### Set a password for OBS Websockets

The [OBS-Websocket](https://github.com/Palakis/obs-websocket) plugin is installed and enabled remote control of OBS on the virtual machine - but by default it does not have a default password.

It is **highly recommended** to protect obs-websocket with a password against unauthorized control. To do this, open the "Websocket server settings" dialog under OBS' "Tools" menu. In the settings dialogs, you can enable or disable authentication and set a password for it.

### Basic OBS Settings

* In OBS go to *File->Settings->Output*
  * At the top change **Output Mode** to **Advanced**
  * Under the streaming Tab ensure the **Encoder** is set to **NVIDIA NVENC**
  * Set the **Bitrate** to an appropriate setting. Recommended **3200 Kbps**
* In OBS go to *File->Settings->Video*
  * Set the **Output(Scaled) Resolution** to **1920x1080**

## Details about deployed Resources

Here's an overview of the deployed topology:

![topology](topology.png)

The following resources will be created

* Virtual Machine
* Network Interface
* Virtual Network
* VM public IP address with DNS
* Network Security group (with HTTP, SSL and OBS web socket ports opened)
* Azure Bastion
* Azure Bastion public IP address with DNS

GPU drivers are installed via NVIDIA extension for Virtual Machines. More details at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/n-series-driver-setup.
